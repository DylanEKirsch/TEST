This version of the task uses spaceships/aliens stimuli and is designed for teenagers and adults.
I have made a number of major changes for the purposes of my work:

For this version of the task:
 - I overhauled the tutorial to ensure that participants could understand the rules and complex dynamics of the game. The new design is based on prior qualitative testing of the task tutorial, as well as feedback from multiple clinical psychologists that specialize in cognitive development.

- I created higher quality stimuli and expanded the stimuli set. This was done so that each block (practice and main game) had entirely different stimuli and the stimuli colors/shapes could be randomized between subjects.

- There are practice rounds and one block of 200 trials. The incentive paradigm is currently in development; it will involve food and be compatible for AN patients as well as healthy controls.
